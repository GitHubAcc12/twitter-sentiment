grand theft auto gta probably already know everything needwant know since believe game starting get little old everyone may agree believe age starting show along issues gta newest pretty much best gta probably already like already dont thisll pretty long tldr bottomin terms performance pc port decently done truth told could better maybe even lot better got passable game pretty well optimized even older laptop pc lot options choose mess around even included one best things open world game pc custom radio station mgsv thing put mp files one games folders allowing listen everything could pirate youtube ingame feature great adds hours music game even normal radio stations already pretty goodthat said ill start singleplayer game play different characters singleplayer opposed usual one novel idea feel stretches story little thin overall less satisfying story experience loved story characters gta iv story characters gta v didnt hold attention much despite overall story characters feeling bit bland lackluster singleplayer long plenty diverse content buy gta v completely singelplayer reasons youll probably satisfied plenty fun messing around san andreasthen comes gta online pretty much half game play usual gta stuff time createacharacter lots players running city mountains rockstar games open world multiplayers gta iv even red dead redemption iteration gta online takes lot amps gta online mode much clearer goals along content general rockstar pretty decent job lot online players grief lot get forced play griefers options nonviolent players random server challenges missions everyone server join one way another overall online great way rack hours gta v even better friends play cost vs earning balance online kind sucks long group friends gaining money wont long hardhowever

biggest issue dont care lot characters story least much gta occasional bugs overall slight ageing game least pc shows cracks singleplayer mostly fineonline issuesa decent connection anything lagginess floatiness npcs players rarity maybe lot international players maybe youd think game would pair people regionthe menus clunky issue wasnt bad singleplayer pause feature slow time feature wasnt ever present threat angry player looking someone blow menus unoptimized use meaning lot things either hidden layers menus mixed giant list one menu lot clicking scrolling even combat weapon wheel disabled

missions bug objectives bug lobbies parties bug weapons bugout equipment bug animations bug lot occasional bugs without talking dreaded hit miss anticheat system havent issues false flagging whatever anticheat admit threat losing dozens upon hundreds hours progress scary greatly reduced want buying game pc gotten level made million ps maybe dont like keep dozens programs running might cause falseflags maybe occasionally run hackers maybe majority negative reviews butthurt hackers got caught lying either way somewhat scary precedent wish rockstar would something going run hackers day least time might quiet sticking giving money guns friends times get people delibrately blowing everyone server spawning things giving unwanted items either trying nice try get banned called

im old gta fan right back beginning also loved earlier saints row games im kind biased towards games gta fun time fact good reckon ill play left imprint brain whenever see hare krishna still instinctually hum grand theft auto grand theft auto grand theft auto try really hard run line caused stir violence ended giving best publicity ever without pay penny gta like godfather crime games metaphorically want godfather game check mafia series kind format mafioso plot upgraded master race thought would got gta v release still waiting red dead redemption pc though guys aresingleplayer rather good run around open world committing crimes avoiding filth great characters plot definitely doesnt include lindsey lohan mark zuckerberg playable characters switch play franklin generic token black dude trying escape hood bland personality make relatable michael retired bank robber likes pay shrink hear complain multi million dollar life style trevor character behaves way players play gta nuff said wont spoil good game especially aaa one funny places offensive everyone equal opportunities rockstar takes mickey stupid society live loved sense humour required enjoy though theres bit torture plot lots crime careful letting kids go play though first judge plot could seen sexist honest everyoneist think sexism people complained writers taking mickey bimbos hollywood stereotypes rather generalising half human race set fictional la expect also men morons andor psychopaths way guys didnt complain game taught women likely complain stuff doesnt matter men due reactions releasesome missions make feel like youre kind badass movie theres old fashioned gta fun like rampages driving hugely improved enough vehicles play could use especially planes choppers boats game also car modding still indicatorsturn signals cars know people hardly use real life come even getaway ps years ago managed people los santos like change lanes rather quickly pain arse youre flying road bad unrealistic ai places terrible people real life dumbvery large map compared previous games visuals great sometimes spectacular natural way places cannot entered interactive way pretty picture look rather world interact personally prefer sacrifice visuals map size content actually use need pretty pictures ill google image search go museum yeah pretty need install app real life smartphone use crappy features course wants access everything phone ignore play fine without theres single player dlc youre done plot theres except mods r dont really like mods modders even though gta london created using modding tools p sometimes cause problems minimum system specs higher steam page says changed updates may corrected bugs considering gameplay format well optimised mid high end machines really good singleplayer game years old grab salenothing see move alongspoilerokay fine theres onlinemultiplayer game called grand theft yourmoney online really dont recommend im really multiplayer games

forever even heist takes hours constant reruns people getting disconnected etcloads cheaters game loads false bannings put hundreds hours game working character building money buying places vehicles taken away reason explanation customer support check reviews theres many cheaters looking sympathy also read somewhere skype cause bannings fair though im surprised people hacked game much way

im old gta fan right back beginning also loved earlier saints row games im kind biased towards games gta fun time fact good reckon ill play left imprint brain whenever see hare krishna still instinctually hum grand theft auto grand theft auto grand theft auto try really hard run line caused stir violence ended giving best publicity ever without pay penny gta like godfather crime games metaphorically want godfather game check mafia series kind format mafioso plot upgraded master race thought would got gta v release still waiting red dead redemption pc though guys aresingleplayer rather good run around open world committing crimes avoiding filth great characters plot definitely doesnt include lindsey lohan mark zuckerberg playable characters switch play franklin generic token black dude trying escape hood bland personality make relatable michael retired bank robber likes pay shrink hear complain multi million dollar life style trevor character behaves way players play gta nuff said wont spoil good game especially aaa one funny places offensive everyone equal opportunities rockstar takes mickey stupid society live loved sense humour required enjoy though theres bit torture plot lots crime careful letting kids go play though first judge plot could seen sexist honest everyoneist think sexism people complained writers taking mickey bimbos hollywood stereotypes rather generalising half human race set fictional la expect also men morons andor psychopaths way guys didnt complain game taught women likely complain stuff doesnt matter men due reactions releasesome missions make feel like youre kind badass movie theres old fashioned gta fun like rampages driving hugely improved enough vehicles play could use especially planes choppers boats game also car modding still indicatorsturn signals cars know people hardly use real life come even getaway ps years ago managed people los santos like change lanes rather quickly pain arse youre flying road bad unrealistic ai places terrible people real life dumbvery large map compared previous games visuals great sometimes spectacular natural way places cannot entered interactive way pretty picture look rather world interact personally prefer sacrifice visuals map size content actually use need pretty pictures ill google image search go museum yeah pretty need install app real life smartphone use crappy features course wants access everything phone ignore play fine without theres single player dlc youre done plot theres except mods r dont really like mods modders even though gta london created

forever even heist takes hours constant reruns people getting disconnected etcloads cheaters game loads false bannings put hundreds hours game working character building money buying places vehicles
